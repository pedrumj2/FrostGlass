# FrostGlass
Utility function in generating a frost glass effect

#Usage
The script basically aligns a background image with its foreground image. Gradients and glass effects should be applied separately. The script also takes care of responsiveness. If the screen dimensions are changed, the images are realigned.


```javascript
var imgAlign = function(__idImg, __idParent, __idParentImg)
```
